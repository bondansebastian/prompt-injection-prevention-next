- Always code early exit where possible, such as: using return statements to exit a function early if a condition is met, or using break statements to exit loops when a condition is satisfied.

- Always use alias "@/" when importing modules, no matter how long or awkward it is.

- When working on tsx or html files, always make sure the mobile responsiveness is working properly.

- Always run nvm use before running any command in the terminal.

- Always prefix your commit messages with the type of change, such as feat, fix, chore, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, or revert.

- Always prefix typescript types with "T" and interfaces with "I".

- Always reuse functions, variables, and components where possible, especially when they are used more than once in different files.

- Introduce as minimal change as possible.
